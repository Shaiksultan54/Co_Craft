## üõ† **Core Problem Statement**  
### **Challenges Faced by Teams**  
1. **Knowledge Fragmentation:**  
   - Scattered documentation and tribal knowledge.  
   - Time-consuming onboarding for new members.  
   - Hours wasted searching for context within codebases.  

2. **Code Comprehension Challenges:**  
   - Lack of contextual understanding of complex codebases.  
   - Inefficient manual code analysis.  
   - Rapidly changing repositories without AI-assisted tracking.  

3. **Collaboration Bottlenecks:**  
   - Misaligned team efforts on complex repositories.  
   - Unstructured meeting notes and missed decisions.  
   - 40% of project time lost to miscommunication.

## üß© **How It Works**  

### **Step 1: Repository Crawling**  
- **GitHub API**: Fetches code, issues, and commits.  
- **LangChain Document Loaders**: Processes files into structured data.

### **Step 2: Embedding & Vector Storage**  
- **Google Gemini Embeddings**: Converts code and documentation into vector format.  
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone/Chroma for fast retrieval of data.

### **Step 3: AI-Powered Query Engine**  
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines vector search and Gemini for context-aware answers.  
- **Meeting Analysis Pipeline**: Uses Assembly AI for transcription and Gemini for summaries.

### **Step 4: User Interaction**  
- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js for intuitive Q&A, dashboards, and collaboration.  
- **Stripe Integration**: Credit-based SaaS model for access to AI processing.
